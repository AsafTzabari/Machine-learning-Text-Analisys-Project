## Project Title: Text Classification for Gender Prediction

### Project Overview

Welcome to the "Text Classification for Gender Prediction" project. This initiative aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting a person's gender based on textual data, such as text narratives or stories. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we will analyze and classify text data into binary gender categories (e.g., male or female).

### Project Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather a dataset of text narratives or stories along with associated gender labels.
   - Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for machine learning.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Apply text vectorization techniques to convert the text data into numerical features.
   - Experiment with various methods, such as CountVectorizer and TF-IDFVectorizer, to represent the text.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Explore different machine learning algorithms for text classification.
   - Consider algorithms like Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) and other classifiers suitable for binary classification tasks.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen models and vectorization methods using techniques like grid search and cross-validation to find the best configuration.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using macro F1-score to assess its ability to predict gender based on text data.
